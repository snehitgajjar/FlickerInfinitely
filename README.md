Android Swipe Image Viewer
--------------------------

This image viewer shows one image at a time. Swiping moves the image back and forth.

The initial implementation uses `ImageSwitcher` with `GestureDetector`:
[ImageSwitcher tag] [1]

Here is my [blog post] [2] explaining how it was made.

It has been updated to use `ViewPager`, which slides the images as you swipe, giving better visual feedback.

Main purpose of this application is to develop and use cache which allow user to traverse

The cache is created in such a way that it fetches perticular amount of photos from the flickr online api as per 
user goes through it.
